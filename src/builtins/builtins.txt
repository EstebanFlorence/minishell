    echo with option -n:
        Parse the input to extract the options and arguments.
        If the -n option is present, set a flag to suppress the trailing newline.
        Print the arguments to the standard output with or without a trailing newline based on the -n flag.

    cd with only a relative or absolute path:
        Parse the input to extract the path argument.
        Use the chdir function from <unistd.h> to change the current working directory.

    pwd with no options:
        Use the getcwd function from <unistd.h> to get the current working directory.
        Print the current working directory to the standard output.

    export with no options:
        Parse the input to extract the environment variable to be exported.
        Use the setenv function from <stdlib.h> or putenv from <stdlib.h> to set the environment variable.

    unset with no options:
        Parse the input to extract the environment variable to be unset.
        Use the unsetenv function from <stdlib.h> to remove the environment variable.

    env with no options or arguments:
        Use the environ global variable to access the environment variables.
        Print all the environment variables to the standard output.

    exit with no options:
        Parse the input to extract the exit status (if provided).
        Use the atoi function from <stdlib.h> to convert the exit status to an integer.
        Use the exit function from <stdlib.h> to terminate the shell with the specified exit status.
